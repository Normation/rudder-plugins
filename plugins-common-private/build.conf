# which can't be a parameter, and must be equals to rudder-branch here)
#

# This version is a little bit different, as it it not for a plugin,
# but we keep the same content for convention and simpler builds.

# Unique identifier of the plugin
plugin-name=plugins-common-private

# Plugin version. It is build as follow: A.B-x.y(.z) with:
# - A.B: Rudder major.minor
# - x.y(.z): plugin major.minor.micro. Micro should be omitted. When omitted, z is assumed to be 0.
# For the build, we split the information between two properties, rudder branch and plugin version,
# which must be concaneted with "-" to build the plugin version.
plugin-branch=1.2

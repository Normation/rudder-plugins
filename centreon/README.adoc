# Plugin for Centreon and Rudder

This project is part of Rudder - IT infrastructure Automation and Compliance.
See: http://rudder.io for more information.

See repository main README for information about licensing, contribution, and
other general information.

== Synopsis

This plugin aims at providing Rudder integration with Centreon. It can
automatically add or remove hosts in Centreon when the corresponding
node is set up for monitoring in Rudder.

The nodes can also have monitoring templates applied using the
appropriate generic methods in the technique editor.

= Centreon

This plugin aims at providing Rudder integration with Centreon. It can
automatically add or remove hosts in Centreon when the corresponding
node is set up for monitoring in Rudder.

The nodes can also have monitoring templates applied using the
appropriate generic methods in the technique editor.

== Installation

* Install a https://download.centreon.com[Centreon server]. The server is
not required to be running on the same host as the Rudder server.
However, this plugin has to be installed and running on the Rudder
server.

* Install the Centreon plugin on your Rudder server.

* Edit the configuration file `/opt/rudder/etc/centreon.conf`. This config
file has to contain your Centreon server’s webservice API URL, the
credentials to access it, and the name of the Centreon poller used to
monitor Rudder nodes (Central by default).

NOTE: make sure that there is no /api in your centreonWebserviceURL.

You can also indicate a default Centreon template to apply to new nodes
added by Rudder.

== Usage

Once the plugin is installed, you need to make an initial synchronization using:

----
/opt/rudder/bin/centreon-plugin synchronize-hosts
----

This will create a *rudder-nodes* host group, and add all your
Rudder nodes to Centreon, adding them to this group.

NOTE: You can re-use this command at any time if you missed some nodes,
      it will only update the information in Centreon.

If you want to manage existing nodes using the Rudder plugin, you need to:

* Make sure they have the same name as in Rudder
* Add them to the *rudder-nodes* group (it is not done automatically
  to prevent unwanted changes)

New nodes added to Rudder will be automatically added to your list
of Centreon hosts (and removed on deletion of the Rudder node).

This is achieved by Rudder’s post-node-acceptance/deletion hooks, which
are calling the plugin with the appropriate options on such events. The
plugin will then make calls to the APIs of the Rudder and Centreon
servers to handle the modifications.


=== Monitoring with Centreon

If you want to monitor your rudder-nodes

In your rudder interface, you can choose among different available rudder directives
or create your own technique editor which is a description in code form of what the agent
has to do on the node and it will be deployed on a rudder-nodes through rules.

Note: Rule is the application of one or more directives to a group of nodes.
It is the glue between both Asset Management and Configuration Management parts of
the application.

* Centreon comes with the possibility to add monitoring templates to its hosts.

* Create a service template model in centreon or check for available ones proposed by Centreon interface.

Once you know the name of a suitable template for a Rudder node/nodegroup, you can add it using the *Monitoring template*
generic method from the technique editor.

In order to configure the monitoring of the Rudder nodes, you can provide Centreon with parameters associated to its hosts. The *Monitoring parameter* generic method achieves this.

At this stage, Centreon supervise your rudder-node services in a fairly synchronized way.

The data will be sent to the Centreon server after the agent and the
synchronization process have run. This synchronization process can be
manually executed by running:

----
/opt/rudder/bin/centreon-plugin apply-configuration
----

on the Rudder server.

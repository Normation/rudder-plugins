= Authentication backends

This plugins allows to use alternative authentication backends for Rudder: *SAMLv2*, *OpenID Connect*, and *LDAP or Active Directory (AD)*.

Each authentication method is detailed below. Users are expected to know how an authentication system works independently of Rudder to configure it in Rudder: you will likely need authentication token, URLs, and other properties provided by your company.

== Configuring log level

Rudder has general info level information for user authentication. They trace what user get connected, with the use of what means.

====
[2020-07-28 12:01:13+0200] INFO  application - Rudder authentication attempt for principal 'alice' with backend 'ldap': success
====

They trace log login failure at trace level:
====
[2023-07-28 12:00:07+0200] INFO  application - Rudder authentication attempt for principal 'alice' with backend 'ldap': failure
[2023-07-28 12:00:07+0200] INFO  application - Rudder authentication attempt for principal 'alice' with backend 'file': failure
[2023-07-28 12:00:07+0200] WARN  application - Login authentication failed for user 'alice' from IP '127.0.0.1': Bad credentials
====

They are enough to follow user authentication. But authentication methods based on central authentication provider can be tricky to configure correctly, and that level of log won't help you to set-up things.
Rudder try to give you helpful information for that task:

- there is a logger for the authentication backend plugin that can help you for general information like configuration:  `<logger name="auth-backends" level="debug" />`
- each authentication backend can provide more information with other loggers, which are in that case documented in their relevant section.

== Centralized user authorization management with OIDC

In addition to alternative authentication provider, the OIDC backends allow to provide Rudder roles through the OIDC token so that you can control your Rudder user authorisation directly from your identity provider.
See OIDC chapter below for more information.

== Configure login form rendering

By default, the standard Rudder login form is displayed. SSO backends like OpenID Connect ones add links to the relevant SSO own login page below that Rudder login form. When you use such an authentication method, you want to hide or totally remove Rudder own login form to avoid to confuse you user. For that, you can use the following property:

```
rudder.auth.displayLoginForm=show
```

Possible values are:

* `show` [default]: show Rudder login form as usual
* `hide`: hide the login form below a toggle button. This is a good option if you want to let your user only see SSO links by default, but still have access to the login form for special cases (like, typically, for emergency admin access when the SSO or network to it is down)
* `remove`: completely remove Rudder login form.

For example, with an OpenID Connect service configured and the `hide` value chosen, your login form will be updated to look like:

image:docs/images/oauth2-oidc-login-form.png[]

== Configure enabled backends

=== Using one external backend for authentication

By default, both authentication and authorization are handle in the `rudder-users.xml`
file. But you may want to rely on your existing enterprise Active Directory or LDAP
to take care of the authentication part.

This behavior can be changed to use one of the provided authentication provider described
below by editing the configuration property `rudder.auth.provider` in
`/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties`.

For example, if you want to use the LDAP/AD authentication backend, you will set:

```
rudder.auth.provider=ldap
```

Identifier for each authentication backend is documented in its respective chapter below.

[NOTE]
=====

After a change in Rudder `/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties` configuration file or any configuration
files under `/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties.d/`, Rudder needs to be restarted with the command:

```
systemctl restart rudder-jetty
```

=====

When set to external provider like 'ldap', passwords in rudder-users.xml are ignored and the
authentication is delegated to the corresponding provider.

By convention, when LDAP authentication is enabled, 'password' field in
`rudder-users.xml` are set to 'LDAP'.


[NOTE]
=====

After a change in `rudder-users.xml` configuration file, you need to reload user
information. This can be done with `user-management` plugin (either in UI or via API,
see that plugin documentation for more information), or by restarting the web
application with the command:

```
systemctl restart rudder-jetty
```

=====

=== Using several backends for authentication

You can also use a comma separated list of authentication providers in `rudder.auth.provider`,
like 'ldap,file' in which case each one will be tested in turned for authentication.


For example, to use first an `ldap` authentication, and then in case the user is not found
in `ldap`, fall-back in file authentication, you will specify:


```
rudder.auth.provider=ldap,file
```

For example, that `rudder-users.xml` file will configure "admin" by file access, and "joe" by LDAP:

```
<authentication hash="sha512" case-sensitivity="true">
  <user name="admin" password="ab7f...b8a538dc69dd8de907ec" role="administrator" />
  <user name="joe" password="LDAP" role="administrator" />
</authentication>
```


[WARNING]
======

Be careful to have only one `rudder.auth.provider` property in your files!

======

[WARNING]
======

If an error happened in one of the authentication modules, the following in the provider sequence won't be tried.

======

== Root access when external authentication is not working

[NOTE]
=====

In case your authentication backend does not work, you can still configure the
`rootAccount` in `/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties` to regain an administrator
access. Once logged as an administrator, you can go to the `Plugins > Authentication
Backends` page to check that Rudder interpreted correctly your configuration.

In particular, check that `Computed list of providers` entry matches your will.

=====


== LDAP / AD backend configuration

LDAP and Active Directories are a common enterprise authentication mean. In Rudder, they are configured with the same backend. That section explain what option are available, and in the following paragraphs we deal with the backend own logger and configuration of a secured (`LDAPS`) connection and how to register the corresponding certificate in Rudder.

=== LDAP backend parameters


The configuration properties needed to configure the LDAP or AD
authentication backend are displayed below.

You should copy the whole configuration properties in a new file under
`/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties.d/`(see
xref:reference:administration:webapp.adoc#_configuration for more detail about
how Rudder configuration properties override works).

Note that key "rudder.auth.provider" is already defined in `/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties`
and will need to be updated in that place:

```
#
# update provider:
#
rudder.auth.provider=ldap
```

```
---- copy into new file /opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties.d/20-ldap-authentication.properties ----


###########################
# LDAP Authentication      #############################################################
###########################


# The following parameters allow to configure the LDAP authentication provider.
# The LDAP authentication procedure is a typical bind/search/rebind, in which
# an application connection (bind) is used to search (search) for an user entry
# given some base and filter parameters, and then, a bind (rebind) is tried on
# that entry with the credential provided by the user.
# That allows to separate the user DN (especially RDN) from the search criteria while
# in the same time supporting users located in several different organisational units.
#
# Be careful, authorizations are still done based on the content of rudder-user.xml,
# meaning that each user should have access to Rudder MUST have a line in that file.
# Without that line, the user can have a successful LDAP authentication, but
# won't be able to do or see anything in Rudder (only logout).
#

# === EXAMPLE / ldapsearch test===
#
# With the example data below, if the user "jon.doe" try to login with password "mypasswd",
# the corresponding `ldapsearch` request are:
#
# 1/ search for user with `service` login:
# ----
# $ ldapsearch -LLL -o ldif-wrap=no -h ldap.mycorp.com -p 389 -x -D "cn=rudder,ou=services,dc=mycorp,dc=com" -w secret -b "ou=Users,dc=mycorp,dc=com" -s sub '(&(cn=jon.doe)(objectclass=person))' 1.1
#
#  dn: cn=jon.doe,ou=Paris,ou=Users,dc=mycorp,dc=com
# ----
#
# Errors and unexpected:
# - an authentication error here means that your rudder service user does not have the
#   rights to do a search and will not be able to find the corresponding user full DN;
# - you should get exactly one result: the DN to use in the second request. If you don't
#   get any results, check the base DN and the LDAP filter.
#
# 2/ bind request with user DN (search user own entry with its credentials):
# ----
# $ ldapsearch -LLL -o ldif-wrap=no -h ldap.mycorp.com -p 389 -x -D "cn=jon.doe,ou=Paris,ou=Users,dc=mycorp,dc=com" -w mypasswd -b "cn=jon.doe,ou=Paris,ou=Users,dc=mycorp,dc=com" -s base 1.1
#
# dn: cn=jon.doe,ou=Paris,ou=Users,dc=mycorp,dc=com
# ----
#
# Errors and unexpected:
# - an authentication error here is likely to mean that the user password is not correct,
#   but you should also check your LDAP directory ACLs.
#

#
# Connection URL to the LDAP server, in the form:
# ldap://hostname:port/base_dn
#
rudder.auth.ldap.connection.url=ldap://ldap.mycorp.com:389/dc=mycorp,dc=com

#
# Bind DN used by Rudder to do the search. This is the "service" or
# "application" DN for Rudder in you LDAP directory, or an LDAP user with
# enough rights to be able to walk the user branch configured below.
# LDAP dn, no default value.
# Be careful to not add quote around the DN, the value is used as provided.
#
rudder.auth.ldap.connection.bind.dn=cn=rudder,ou=services,dc=mycorp,dc=com

#
# Bind password used by Rudder service (the DN configured just above) to do the search.
# String, no default value.
#
rudder.auth.ldap.connection.bind.password=secret

#
# If your directory uses remote links that need to be deferenced
# for resolving the actual entry, for example in the case of an
# AD forest, you need to uncomment the following option.
#
# rudder.auth.ldap.connection.derefLink=true

#
# Search base and filter to use to find the user.
# The search base can be left empty. In that
# case, the root of directory is used.
#
rudder.auth.ldap.searchbase=ou=People

#
# In the filter, {0} denotes the value provided as
# login by the user.
# The filter must lead to at most one result, which
# will be used to try the (re)bind request.
#
rudder.auth.ldap.filter=(&(uid={0})(objectclass=person))

#
# An AD example would be:
#
#rudder.auth.ldap.searchbase=
#rudder.auth.ldap.filter=(&(sAMAccountName={0})(objectclass=user))

```
=== LDAP backend logger

In addition to the common loggers, LDAP backend use the `org.springframework.security.ldap` namespace.
You can configure the corresponding logger in `/opt/rudder/etc/logback.xml` at debug or trace level by adding the line:

====

<logger name="org.springframework.security.ldap" level="trace" />

====

This will lead to trace looking like:

====
[2023-07-28 12:00:07+0200] TRACE org.springframework.security.ldap.authentication.BindAuthenticator - Searching for user using FilterBasedLdapUserSearch [searchFilter=(&(cn={0})(objectclass=person)); searchBase=ou=Users; scope=subtree; searchTimeLimit=0; derefLinkFlag=false ]

=== Using a certificate for secure connection to LDAP/AD

If you want to connect with a secure connection to an LDAP or AD, you need to add the
directory certificate to Rudder's JVM `keystore`.

Without that, you will see errors in `/var/log/rudder/webapp/XXXXXXX_stderrout.log` files like:

```
WARN  application - Login authentication failed for user 'xxx' from IP '127.0.0.1|X-Forwarded-For:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx': simple bind failed: xxx.xxx:636; nested exception is javax.naming.CommunicationException: simple bind failed:

xxx.xxx:636 [Root exception is java.net.SocketException: Connection or outbound has closed]
```

**Adding certificate to JVM keystore**

```
# copy the certificate somewhere in /opt/rudder

cd path/to/jdk<in-use-version>/lib/security

keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -keystore cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt -alias "rudder-ldap-certificate" -file <path to AD server certificate>
```

**Error because certificate is 1024 bits**

Since JVM version 8, certificate of size 1024 or less are forbidden by default. If you still use a certificate with that size, you will get errors
like:

```
Root exception is javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: PKIX path validation failed: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Algorithm constraints check failed on keysize limits: RSA 1024 bit key used with certificate
```


To correct that problem, you need to remove that restriction (and update your certificates for security):

* edit `path/to/jdk<in-use-version>/conf/security/java.security`
* check constraints on `RSA keysize` like `RSA keySize < 1024` and change them to match your key size for properties:
  * `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms`
  * `jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms`
* restart `rudder-jetty`

=== OAUTHv2 / OpenID Connect (OIDC)

https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] (OIDC) is a very common SSO protocol to authenticate and manage authorizations of users in a decentralized, multi-tenant set-up (ie, typically web applications nowadays). It's built on top of `OAUTHv2` and replace it in most new cases.

These protocols delegate the actual authentication to an identity provider (IdP) that in turns send the relevant authentication information to the client, i.e. to Rudder in our case. These `IdP` can be public providers, like https://google.com[Google], deployed and managed internally in a company, like ForgeRock's open source https://forgerock.github.io/openam-community-edition/[OpenAM], or used as SaaS, like https://okta.com[Okta] - and often, providers do a mix of these things.

Rudder support plain old `OAUTHv2` and `OpentID Connect`. They have several normalized scenario and Rudder supports the most common for a web application server side authentication: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[Authentication using Authorization Code Flow].

[notice]
====

We advise to use OICD over SAMLv2 if possible.

====

To use these providers, you need to update the `rudder.auth.provider` property with the `oauth2` value for an `OAUTHv2` identity provider, and with the `oidc` value for an `OpenID Connect` identity provider.

As always, you can have several back-ends configured for fall-back authentication. For example, to use `OIDC` with a fall-back to the Rudder file based authentication, use:

```
rudder.auth.provider = oidc, file
```

You can configure several providers at the same time.
The are defined by an identifier in a comma-separated list in the following property:

```
rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.registrations=okta,google
```


Each provider needs to then have a bunch of properties defined for it. They are listed below and all follow the pattern `rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.${providerID}.${subPath} where `providerId` is the ID in the previous list, and `subPath` is the remaining name of the property.

We advise to configure each provider in its own configuration file under `/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties.d`
so that it is easier to change or disable some of them.

=== IdP-provided authorisations for Rudder users

You can configure an OAuth2 or OIDC provider so that it informs Rudder of the roles the user need to have. This allows to centrally
manage both user and authorisation in the same place.

This feature works with the `custom roles` feature provided by the xref:plugins:user-management.adoc[user-management plugin]. Please see that linked documentation to understand how custom roles work in Rudder.

You need three additional properties to enable and configure that property for a given OIDC provider:
- the first, `roles.enabled` allows to enable the feature,
- the second, `roles.attribute` defines the name of the OIDC token attribute which holds the list of roles,
- the third, `roles.override` defines if the OIDC provided roles must be the only one the user get, or if they
  are merged with the `rudder-users.xml` ones.

See the example configuration file below for details about these property values.

=== Example configuration for `okta` provider

In this section, we use `okta` as OIDC provider, and we chose the name `okta` to identify that provider in Rudder configuration file.

We chose this OIDC provider because it provides freely available
https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcode/main/#next-steps[extensive documentation and testing platform].
This can be useful since OAUTHv2/OpenID Connect configuration can be a bit complicated and full of jargon.

In the remaining part of this section, you will need to change `okta` by the name you chose to identify your OIDC provider in Rudder.

You can copy the following example into `/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties.d/30-oidc-okta-authentication.properties`.

```
# Authentication provider id in rudder.auth.provider:
# - OAUTHv2       : oauth2
# - OpenID Connect: oidc

# Configure the list of Identity provider services. Here, you choose
# an identifier for each service as a comma separated list.
# Identifier should be lower case ascii, -, _. For example, if
# your company uses both "Okta" and "Google", you can choose "okta" and
# "google" (how original) identifiers:
rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.registrations=okta,google

# Now, configure Okta related properties. You will need to do
# the same for each provider with an identifier.

# The identity service provider name as it will be displayed in Rudder
rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.okta.name=Okta
# A more detailed explanation message displayed in authentication page.
rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.okta.ui.infoMessage=OpenID Connect SSO (Okta)

# In Oauth2/OIDC, a client (ie, Rudder) is identifier by a pair of credentials:
# - 1/ an id,
# - 2/ a corresponding secret key.
#
# 1/ Identifier of the application you created in your IdP for Rudder.
#    In Okta, it will be listed under https://xxxx-admin.okta.com/admin/apps/active
#    once you created it with "Create App Integration". If you click on your application,
#    it's located in "Client Credential > Client ID".
#
rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.okta.client.id=0oa3snkopsIRIIHb35d7
#
# 2/ The corresponding "client secret", provided by your Identity Provider.
#    For Okta, it's available when you click on your application in
#    https://xxxx-admin.okta.com/admin/apps/active in "Client Credential > Client Secret"
rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.okta.client.secret=-0Q5jGbdvV5WkfGNJwHfkOP0FdZ5vhqPYav7icYb
#
# Space separated list of OAUTHv2 "scope" for claims that should be included in the identity
# token once authentication is done. These values should be documented by your IdP documentation.

# `userId` (see next property)
rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.okta.scope=openid  email profile
#
# The attribute that will be used for `userId` and login matching with rudder users
# (generally, it's a login or email ; OIDC always provides at least `sub` attribute)
# The value of that attribute will be used to retrieved Rudder internal user, its rights, etc.
rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.okta.userNameAttributeName=email
#
# The next 4 URLs are the redirection URLs towards the IdP and which correspdonds to
# each step of the authentication process (yes, the protocol does a lot of redirection):
# - `uri.auth`: first URL, Rudder ask for a code request. User is then redirected by
#    the IdP towards its own login form. It then redirect to Rudder with a code to process.
#    If you need to use extra information like an `acr_values` property, just happen it to that URL
# - `uri.token`: Rudder returned the code processed with its client secret. The IdP process it
     and return an authentication token to Rudder.
# - `uri.userInfo`: Rudder uses the authentication token to get user information on that URL
# - `uri.jwkSet`: in the case of OIDC, the token is a signed JWT token. That last url is the
#   URL where Rudder can get the IdP public key to sign the token.
rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.okta.uri.auth=https://xxxx.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize

```


==== Log information

OIDC and OAuth2 protocols may become complicated to configure, especially for the scopes part, when you
need to match an attribute with Rudder login base.
You can use the log level for `auth-backends` in `/opt/rudder/etc/logback.xml`:

- `debug` to see which attributes are actually returned into the user info token,
- and `trace` to also see their values.

==== Common Oauth2/OIDC error cases

It can be a bit challenging to understand what is not correct in a Oauth2 or OIDC configuration.
Here are some guide lines to help address possible configuration problems.

*I don't see the list of Identity Provider in login form*

Check that you correctly updated parameter `rudder.auth.provider` to include `oidc` or `oauth2` in
the list, that you have at least one key defined in `rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.registrations`, and
that you have Rudder webapp logs (`/var/log/rudder/webapp/YYYY_mm_dd.stderrout.log`) lines like:

----
[timestamp] INFO  application - Configured authentication provider(s): [rootAdmin, oidc, file]
[timestamp] INFO  application - Add backend providers 'Oauth2 and OpenID Connect authentication backends provider: 'oauth2','oidc'
[timestamp] INFO  application.plugin - Oauthv2 or OIDC authentication backend is enabled, updating login form
----

*I get a 404 page not found on Identity Provider*

Check with your Identity Provider Manager that the URL for `rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.${registrationKey}.uri.auth` is correct.

*I get a 400 bad request on Identity Provider*

If when you click in Rudder login page to the IdP link and that you get an error 400 "bad request",
the application code for Rudder is not correct, and so Rudder identity is not recognized by the IdP.
Check with your IdP provider the application code for Rudder and check that that value is correctly
set for property `rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.${registrationKey}.client.id`

*After login on Identity Provider, I get a "login error" message in Rudder login page*

This can have several cause and we will need to analyse Rudder log to understand what happened.

**Bad token URL**

In the log, you see (exact error code or ID may vary, check `invalid_token_response` and `The endpoint does not support the provided HTTP method`):

----
[timestamp] DEBUG auth-backends - Processing OAuth2/OIDC authorization to: https://identity-provider-url/oauth2/v1/authorize
[timestamp] DEBUG auth-backends - Processing OAuth2/OIDC authorisation validation and starting authentication request
[timestamp] WARN  application - Login authentication failed for user 'unknown' from IP '127.0.0.1': [invalid_token_response] An error occurred while attempting to retrieve the OAuth 2.0 Access Token Response: 405 Method Not Allowed: "{"errorCode":"E0000022","errorSummary":"The endpoint does not support the provided HTTP method","errorLink":"E0000022","errorId":"oaeLqoJpDbwTzOTAJhp9TbVig","errorCauses":[]}"
----

Check with you Identity Provider Manager the value for `rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.${registrationKey}.uri.token`.

**Bad user info URL**

In the log, you see (exact error code or ID may vary, check `invalid_user_info_response` and `The endpoint does not support the provided HTTP method`):

----
[timestamp] DEBUG auth-backends - Processing OAuth2/OIDC authorization to: https://identity-provider-url/oauth2/v1/authorize
[timestamp] DEBUG auth-backends - Processing OAuth2/OIDC authorisation validation and starting authentication request

**Bad JWK (keys) URL**

In the log, you see (exact error code or ID may vary, check `invalid_id_token` and `The endpoint does not support the provided HTTP method`):

----

**Bad application secret or method**

In the log, you see:

----
[timestamp] DEBUG auth-backends - Processing OAuth2/OIDC authorization to: https://identity-provider-url/oauth2/v1/authorize
[timestamp] DEBUG auth-backends - Processing OAuth2/OIDC authorisation validation and starting authentication request

----

This likely means that the value of `rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.${registrationKey}.client.secret` is incorrect. Please check with your Identity Provider manager to get the correct one.

It could also mean that your Identity Provider only support the `client_secret_post` authentication
method. You can try to change `rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.okta.authMethod` to that value.

**User attribute unknown**

In the log, you see:

----
[timestamp] DEBUG auth-backends - Processing OAuth2/OIDC authorization to: https://identity-provider-url/oauth2/v1/authorize
[timestamp] DEBUG auth-backends - Processing OAuth2/OIDC authorisation validation and starting authentication request
[timestamp] DEBUG auth-backends - OAuth2/OIDC user info request with scopes [email openid profile] returned attributes: email, email_verified, family_name, given_name, locale, name, nickname, preferred_username, sub, updated_at, zoneinfo
[timestamp] WARN  application - Login authentication failed for user 'unknown' from IP '127.0.0.1': [oauth2:invalid_user_info_response] Missing attribute 'foo' in attributes
----

You used an attribute for value `rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.${registrationKey}.userNameAttributeName` that is not returned with the user profile.
Please check `rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.okta.scope` with your Identity Provider Manager to ensure that the list of scope is correct, and check that the `userNameAttributeName` value is in the list of `returned attributes`.

**Incorrect user attribute**

In the log, you see:

----
[timestamp] DEBUG auth-backends - Processing OAuth2/OIDC authorization to: https://identity-provider-url/oauth2/v1/authorize
[timestamp] DEBUG auth-backends - Processing OAuth2/OIDC authorisation validation and starting authentication request
[timestamp] DEBUG auth-backends - OAuth2/OIDC user info request with scopes [email openid profile] returned attributes: email, email_verified, family_name, given_name, locale, name, nickname, preferred_username, sub, updated_at, zoneinfo
[timestamp] WARN  application - Login authentication failed for user 'unknown' from IP '127.0.0.1': User with username 'foo' was not found
----

It means that the value used for `rudder.auth.oauth2.provider.${registrationKey}.userNameAttributeName` was correctly returned in the profile list for the authenticated user, but that value was not found in Rudder user configuration files `/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-users.xml`.
Check that one of the entries in that file has the corresponding value for its `name` attribute.

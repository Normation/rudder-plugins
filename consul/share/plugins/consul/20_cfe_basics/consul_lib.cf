# Fetches the configuration to be used for this run.
# The config is located at "config_path". It is a JSON file containing two fields : a server_addr and an auth dictionary :
#{
#   "server_addr": "YOUR_CONSUL_SERVER",
#   "token": "PasteYourTokenHere" [OPTIONAL]
#}
#
# The auth field can contain one field for each auth mode, with the latter as key name. It needs a "mode" field to determine which one to use.

This plugin provides integration between Rudder and GLPI. It will send
to your GLPI server the up-to-date inventories processed by the Rudder
server.

== Installation

* Install a https://glpi-project.org/[GLPI server]. The server is not
required to be running on the same host as the Rudder server. However,
this plugin has to be installed and running on the Rudder server.
* Install the
https://github.com/fusioninventory/fusioninventory-for-glpi/releases[fusion inventory plugin for GLPI]
* Install the glpi plugin on your Rudder server
* Installe `xmlstarlet`
* Edit the configuration file in `/opt/rudder/etc/glpi.conf`. This config
file must contain the URL to your GLPI serverâ€™s fusion inventory plugin.

[WARNING]

====

The glpiinventory plugin of GLPI looks to be the same as the fusioninventory plugin, but it is not.
The glpiinventory plugin refuses some elements present in fusioninventory for Rudder, so
it doesn't work with Rudder inventories. Please use the fusioninventory plugin instead.

====


== Usage

Run `/opt/rudder/bin/glpi-plugin send-all` to update all the inventories.
This command is run automatically everyday around 7AM.

To manuallyi update an inventory for a specific node, run `/opt/rudder/bin/glpi-plugin send-one UUID`.
The plugin will automatically send a new inventory upon node
addition to Rudder.

NOTE: All nodes inventories are sent daily to GLPI, including pending nodes.

# Rudder plugin: API Authorizations

This project is part of Rudder - IT infrastructure Automation and Compliance.
See: http://rudder.io for more information.

See repository main README for information about licensing, contribution, and
other general information.


== Synopsis

This plugin provides fine grained Access Control List on APIs.
It also allows registered Rudder users to get private token with the same
rights as their role allows.

== Logging

You can log information about ACL (behavior and errors) by adding the following lines in your ```logback.xml``` file:


```

  <!--
      API ACLs
      ========
      Information about ALC evalutation for APIs.

      This logger allows to get extra information about API
      ACLs resolution.

   -->
  <logger name="api-acl" level="off" />
```

// Everything after this line goes into Rudder documentation

== User personnal API Token

When you use `api-authorizations` plugin, any logged user can get a personnal API token by clicking on
its login information:

Once you click on the button, you get you personnal API token that can get revoked at any time:

The user can use that token to execute API requests for the same action that his role allows him to do:

These actions are recorded as done by the user owning the API token in Rudder events log:

== API ACLs

The plugin also allows to configure fine grained access control for a token. By selecting
"Custom ACL" access level, you can choose what endpoints are accessible for that API token.

For example, you can create an API token which can only access compliance information:

image:api-authorizations/api-authorizations-new-token-description.png[Create a new API token with "ACL" access level]

image:api-authorizations/api-authorizations-new-token-acl.png[And only authorize access to compliance endpoints]

That token can of course access `compliance` related endpoints:

image:api-authorizations/api-authorizations-curl-success.png[Token can access compliance information]

But if it tries to access an other endpoint, it get an authorization error:

image:api-authorizations/api-authorizations-curl-error.png[Token is not authorized to access directives information]

  "longDescription": "Description: Monitor the use of system calls associated with the deletion or renaming of files and file attributes. This configuration statement sets up monitoring for the unlink (remove a file), unlinkat (remove a file attribute), rename (rename a file) and renameat (rename a file attribute) system calls and tags them with the identifier \"delete\". Rationale: Monitoring these calls from non-privileged users could provide a system administrator with evidence that inappropriate removal of files and file attributes associated with protected files is occurring. While this audit option will look at all events, system administrators will want to look for specific privileged files that are being deleted or altered.",

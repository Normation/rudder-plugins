  "longDescription": "Description: The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) provides networked computers with the ability to transfer files. Rationale: FTP does not protect the confidentiality of data or authentication credentials. It is recommended sftp be used if file transfer is required. Unless there is a need to run the system as a FTP server (for example, to allow anonymous downloads), it is recommended that the package be deleted to reduce the potential attack surface.",

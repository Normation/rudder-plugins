  "longDescription": "Description: Avahi is a free zeroconf implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery. Avahi allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts running on a local network with no specific configuration. For example, a user can plug a computer into a network and Avahi automatically finds printers to print to, files to look at and people to talk to, as well as network services running on the machine. Rationale: Automatic discovery of network services is not normally required for system functionality. It is recommended to disable the service to reduce the potential attach surface.",

  "longDescription": "Description: The Common Unix Print System (CUPS) provides the ability to print to both local and network printers. A system running CUPS can also accept print jobs from remote systems and print them to local printers. It also provides a web based remote administration capability. Rationale: If the system does not need to print jobs or accept print jobs from other systems, it is recommended that CUPS be disabled to reduce the potential attack surface.",

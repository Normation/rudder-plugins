# rudder-plugins

This is the repository for plugins for Rudder: Continuous configuration for effective compliance.

https://www.rudder-project.org/site/documentation/

== Creating a new plugin


If you want to create a new plugin, you can use giter8 (http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/) on
that repository or directly from the file system.

Once `g8` command is installed (see http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/setup.html), use:

```
% g8 file://.
```
You can alos use the github resolution:

```
% g8 normation/rudder-plugins
```

And answer the questions. Only the `name` is mandatory: use the plugin short name, with
space and capital if you want  (see convetion below).
Juste hitting <ENTER> choose the default value (the one between []).

```
name [My Plugin]: Node External Reports <ENTER>
version [1.0 ]: <ENTER>
title_description [One line description of plugin]: Add external reports in node details
web_description [<p>HTML description of plugin</p>]: <p>Add external reports in node details</p>
you_should_not_change_following_variables [just hit enter]: <ENTER>
plugin_name [node-external-reports]: <ENTER>
plugin_pkg [nodeexternalreports]: <ENTER>
plugin_class [NodeExternalReports]: <ENTER>
```

If you don't want to use giter8, you can replace by hand the placeholders `$plugin_name$`,
`$plugin_pkg$` and `$plugin_class$` using the same convention as the previous example.
Be careful to replace them in both file (with `sed` for example) and in path (with `mv`).

== Repository structure


The repository is organized with one directory for each plugin under repository root directory.

Each plugin's root directory is named with the plugin "shortname identifier", i.e the plugin name
minus 'rudder-plugin-" prefix.

Each plugin build information are grouped in file `build.conf` in plugin root directory.

== Branch versionning and compatibility with Rudder versions


Plugins are linked to Rudder patch version, so we retrieve in `rudder-plugins` the same branch
structure than in `rudder`. Moreover, one needs to always compile and use a plugin for the
corresponding Rudder patch version:

```
- branches/rudder/7.2-next (plugin compatible with Rudder next 7.2 version, i.e developing branch)
- branches/rudder/7.2.4 (plugins compatible with Rudder 7.2.4)
- branches/rudder/7.3.0 (plugins compatible with Rudder 7.3.0)
- etc
```

This  scheme allows to ensure total binary compatiblity, and upgrade is done automatically by rudder package at upgrade.


== Plugin version and Tag convention


Plugin versions are composed in two parts separated by a `-`:

- the Rudder corresponding version (including the patch number),
- the plugin own version in format X.Y(.Z) where the Z part is optionnal.

For example, the `datasources` plugin, in own version 2.1, for Rudder 7.2.3 will get version: `7.2.3-2.2`.

This version is used to postfix plugin package name.

Each plugin follow his own development pace, and so there is no release cycle for plugins. Each time a plugin
reaches a new step, a version for it is published by changing version information in its `build.conf` file.
The related commit is tagged with the convention: `pluginShortName-pluginVersion`.

You can get all the versions for a given plugins with the `git tag --list` command. For example, for the `datasources` plugin:

```
$ git tag --list 'datasources-*'

# results
datasources-7.2.1-2.2
datasources-7.2.2-2.2
datasources-7.2.3-2.2
datasources-7.2.4-2.2
datasources-7.3.0.beta1-2.3

```

== Building plugins

=== Building and Java stack requirements


All plugins share the same build infrastructure based on Make.

You will need:

- standard `make` tool chain,
- `ar`, and for any plugin with scala code (i.e most of them),
- `maven` in version 3.2 or up,
- `Java 11 JDK tools (javac, jar, etc).

For information, this the list of package that need to be installed on a minimal linux distribution:

```
openjdk-11-jdk maven binutils make git-core xz-utils
```

For the branding plugin, you need to have elm-install present on the system

```
npm install -g  elm
```

To build a plugin package, do:

```
git checkout tag-corresponding-to-plugin-vesion
make clean && make generate-all-pom && make plugin-name
```

After compilation, you will find in plugin root directory (i.e at the same level than the Makefile file) the
plugin package: `pluginShortName-pluginVersion.rpkg`.

This package can then be transferred to a Rudder server and installed with the command:

```
/opt/rudder/bin/rudder-pkg install-file /path/to/pluginShortName-pluginVersion.rpkg
```

=== Building licensed / limited plugin version


Plugins can have a license and adapt there behavior based on runtime license information.
The licensing framework is not open source, and such plugin need access to Rudder private repositories.

The common API can be build and installed in user local maven repository with the following command line
when on `rudder-plugins` directory (for example for `datasources`, use the same `-licensed` naming
convention for other):

```
make datasources-licensed
```

The file `license.sign` is a license information file signed with the private key matching the public one
used in the command line. The path of `license.sign` is relative to the plugin directory, so in our example,
it will be located at: `./datasources/license.sign`

== Licensing

License are by-plugin and the license for a given plugin is specified in the LICENSE file in its plugin directory.

Nonetheless most projects are licensed under GNU GPLv3 license (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt) or
ASLv2 (https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
